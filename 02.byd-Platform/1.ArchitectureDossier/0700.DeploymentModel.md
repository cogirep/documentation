# Deployment Model

## Principles

The deployment of the solution is based on source code repositories and a continuous integration / continuous deployment ("_CI/CD_") platform and deployment environments.

### Main components

The **main components** of the solutions are:

_ToDo: add main components list and diagramm_

![Software Model]()


### Source code repositories

There is one repository per **identified component** based on application code (and Running on Node.js or Angular).

The **source code repositories** are hosted in Sixense Digital GitHub account.

_ToDo: add diagramm of the git repo_

![GitHub]()

### CI/CD platform

_ToDo: to be reviewed by Vincent H._

The **CI/CD platform** is hooked to these source code repositories to build, test, package and deploy the solution artefacts for the development and integration environments. there is one **delivery pipeline** per environment.
On the other environments, deployment is currently manual.

### Deployment environments

The following **environments** are used:

_ToDo: add environments list and diagram_


![Environments]()

### Components packaging

According to architecture decisions (see [Docker](./0601.ArchitectureDecisions.md) and [Kubernetes](./0602.ArchitectureDecisions.md) architecture decisions), the solution (except database) is packaged as Docker containers, orchestrated in a **Kubernetes cluster**.
The **databases** are deployed on MongoDB and Postgresql (both PaaS editions) available on the selected cloud environment.

_ToDo: add these arch decisions_

_ToDo: add deployment diagram_

## System integration

_ToDo: list integrated systems (if any)_

## URLs

The following URLs are the system entry points for end users and client applications (browser and machine to machine communication):

_ToDo: list URLs_

|Environment|Component|Accessible through Internet (Y/N)|Sixense Digital URL|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| | | | |

## Operational model

The operational model is detailed on the Confluence project space.

_ToDo: add confluence link_
