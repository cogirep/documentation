## NodeJS Unit Testing

### Introduction

Developers shall use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) to perform their unit tests. Every JS file shall have its test file allowing to test all or at least its main functions. This project is a unit test example. For more information about Jest please refer to the [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html).

### How To Use

#### Install

Once you've cloned this project, execute the following command inside the project folder to retrieve all the required packages :

```
npm install
```

#### Execute Test

To execute unit testing, execute the following command inside the project folder:

```
npm test
```

#### How Does It Work ?

`Jest` by default detects all the files with suffix `.test.js`. Thereby developers shall add suffix `.test.js` for all testing files.

##### Examples

###### Synchronous Test

The file `sum.js` contains a simple `sum` function as follow :

```javascript
var sum = function(a, b){
    return a + b;
};

module.exports = sum;
```

The testing file should be called `sum.test.js`. Following an example of how we could test `sum`:

```javascript
/*
we first load the module we want to test
here sum is a function
*/
var sum = require("./sum");

/*
calling test function which is provided by jest
The first argument is always a comment about the test,
the second is a function holding the test
*/
test("1 + 2 should equal 3", function(){
    /*
        Testing that the result of sum(1,2) should be equal to 3
    */
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

###### Asynchronous Test

The file `async_sum.js` contains an asynchronous version of `sum` :

```javascript
var async_sum = function(a, b, callback){
    setTimeout(function(){
        return callback(null, a+b);
    }, 500);
};

module.exports = async_sum;
```

The testing file should be called `async_sum.test.js`.

In order to test an asynchronous function, the content of the test should be encapsulated inside a callback function you shall define:

```javascript
//loading the module we want to test
const async_sum = require("./async_sum");

test('10 + 5 is equal 15 [asynchronous]', function() {
    //defining the callback function containing the test
    function callback(error, data) {
        expect(error).toBeNull(); //the error should be null, e.g no error
        expect(data).toBe(15);    // the result of 10 + 5 should be 15
    }
    async_sum(10, 5, callback); // executing test
});
```


##### Web Service Testing

In order to test web services (routes) we need an additional module `supertest`
```bash
npm install --save-dev supertest
```

**N.B:** since we are using **Node V6.11** the syntax [`async/await`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-async.html#async-await) is not supported. We use promises provided by `supertest`.

Say we have the following app :

```javascript
const serverless = require('serverless-http')
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const path = require('path')
//including route
app.use(require(path.join(__dirname, 'routes/hello-world')))
//wrapping in servless for lambda usage in AWS. See Lambda coding standard for more info
module.exports.handler = serverless(app)
//exporting the express app
module.exports.app = app
```

With the following route :

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()
router.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.json('HELLO WORLD')
})
module.exports = router
```

Here's how we can test the "HELLO WORLD" service:

```javascript
/* global describe, test, expect */

const server = require('../app').app          //loading the app which is exported under app. see lambda design pattern in order to understand the reason
const request = require('supertest')          //loading supertest

describe('Testing Hello-World Route', function () {
  test('Service "/" should respond as expected', function (done) {
    request(server).get('/') //requesting the server '/' corresponding to "HELLO WORLD"
    .then(function (response) { //executed when response is OK
      expect(response.status).toEqual(200)              //Testing status code
      expect(response.type).toEqual('application/json') //Testing Content-Type
      expect(response.body).toEqual('HELLO WORLD')      //Testing the body response
      done()                                            //when done is executed, means the end of the test
    }, function (err) { //function executed when something went wrong
      expect(err).toBeNull()
      done()
    })
  })
})
```

Executing `npm test` should execute the test file.

###### Configuration

In order to add `Jest` as the default testing tool, the developer shall add `Jest` to the test script in `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "test-pattern",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "sum.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "UNLICENSED",
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest-cli": "^22.1.4"
  }
}
```
